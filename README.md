WordPhing
=========

WordPress build and test system using Phing.
http://www.phing.info

- Automated Installing/Moving/Testing/Scripting and php'ing WordPress from the command line
- This is Beta! 
- Currently works and builds WordPress in about 25 seconds depending on your Internet connection.


This is a fork of https://github.com/etivite/phing-wordpress-installer/ to make it prompt freindly , if you just want config files use etivite's instead :)

Why Phing? Because it's built with PHP.
